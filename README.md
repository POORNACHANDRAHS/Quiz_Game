# üß† Simple Python Quiz Game

Welcome to the **Simple Python Quiz Game**! This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of a basic quiz game built with Python. It aims to reinforce fundamental programming concepts while providing an engaging experience for users.

## üéØ Project Overview

The **Simple Python Quiz Game** is a console-based application designed to test users' knowledge with a series of multiple-choice questions. The game is structured to be intuitive and easy to play, making it perfect for those new to programming or looking to practice basic Python skills.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Gameplay**: The game presents users with three carefully curated questions, each with four possible answers.
- **User Input Handling**: Players can select their answers by entering the corresponding number (1-4). Input validation is included to ensure smooth gameplay.
- **Instant Feedback**: After each question, users receive immediate feedback on whether their answer was correct or incorrect, along with the correct answer if they were wrong.
- **Scoring System**: A simple scoring mechanism tracks correct answers, displaying the final score at the end of the game.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The game begins with a brief introduction and rules overview, ensuring players understand how to participate.

### üöÄ Getting Started

To run the quiz game on your local machine, simply clone the repository and execute the Python script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/POORNACHANDRAHS/Quiz_Game.git
cd Quiz_Game
python Quiz_Game.py
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into a single Python script, `quiz_game.py`, which contains all the necessary functions and logic:

- **get_user_answer()**: Handles user input, ensuring valid entries.
- **check_answer()**: Evaluates the user's answer and provides feedback.
- **quiz_game()**: Main game loop that presents questions, collects answers, and calculates the score.

### üìö Learning Objectives

This project serves as an excellent introduction to several core Python concepts, including:
- Control flow with conditional statements (`if`, `else`).
- User input handling and validation.
- Simple function usage for modular code.
- Basic console-based user interaction.

### üåü Inspiration and Acknowledgements

The Simple Python Quiz Game was inspired by the desire to create an engaging and educational tool for beginners. Special thanks to the Python programming community for their invaluable resources and support.
